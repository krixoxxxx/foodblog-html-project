            <ul>
                <li>The chocolates taste was a bit overpowering, the milk chocolate was very salty, the dark was very good but the white was overpowering. The aroma of the dark chocolate was rich, although the rest felt like ordinary chocolate.</li>
                <li>I didn't learn any new skills.</li>
                <li>The aroma of the dark chocolate was rich, although the rest felt like ordinary chocolate.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed pouring and mixing the chocolate, working with chocolate is rather calming.</li>
                <li>A challenge I faced was not pouring too much chocolate into the mold, I spilt a tiny bit at one point.</li>
                <li>If I were to modify the experiment I would add a double boiler and more interesting ingredients.</li>

            <h2>Pancakes</h2>
        </div>

            <ul>
                <li>The pancakes were the most fun, they looked really messy because of 1 pancake not having anything in it and the whipped cream to cover up the spilt powdered sugar. The texture of the pancakes was normal, the pancake on the top felt a bit mushy though.</li>
                <li>The aroma was amazing because the mango added a nice fruit smell while the whipped cream radiated sweetness.</li>
                <li>I learnt to plan ahead what I will put into pancakes.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed making the pancakes a lot because they're so easy and simple.</li>
                <li>Finding the right heat was a bit hard.</li>
                <li>I would not change anything.</li>

            <h2>Burrito Bowl</h2>
        </div>
            <ul>
                <li>The burrito bowl was a bit meh, the rice got burnt and the table got pretty messy at times. The food tasted amazing though, the beef was a bit dry but it tasted really good, the mix of sour cream salsa rice and beef was simply supreme.</li>
                <li>The food had a rich aroma because of the beef, the touch of lemon juice was also great.</li>
                <li>I learnt to use lower heats so I can reduce liquids better.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed this because it was really delicious.</li>
                <li>I burnt the rice. :C</li>
                <li>I'd use a rice cooker, cooking in a pot was painful.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>THE MILKSHAKE WAS AMAZING I HAD 2 OF THEM, they were a lil bit messy though, they were runny and the chocolate at the bottom didn't blend, but they were still amazing.</li>
                <li>The smell was strong with caramel and oreo, it was a very sweet aroma.</li>
                <li>Learnt that I should definitely blend for longer.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed the milkshakes because they were simply amazing.</li>
                <li>The milkshake wasnt fully blended.</li>
                <li>I'd have more chocolate.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The rocky road wasnt as good, it was very thick and just mediocre.</li>
                <li>Didn't have much of an aroma except for a light oreo.</li>
                <li>I learnt to better plan chocolate-making.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed the rocky road a bit, but it was too chunky to eat properly.</li>
                <li>The rocky road didnt solidify fast enough.</li>
                <li>I'd have a bigger tray so the chocolate isnt as chunky.</li>

                <li>The aroma was very rich in umami because of all the seasonings and beef stock.</li>
                <li>I didn't learn anything new.</li>
                <li>I enjoyed the tacos a lot, the mess was okay but everything was amazing.</li>
                <li>The tacos wouldnt stay together.</li>
                <li>I'd have more meat so the tacos would be yummier.</li>

                <li>The hamburger was okay at best, I ate it all because I was hungry, hope the next dish will be better.</li>
                <li>Odd aroma, big taste and smell of dill because I added a whole tbsp.</li>
                <li>Didn't learn anything.</li>
                <li>I thought it was okay, didn't enjoy too much.</li>
                <li>The burger wouldnt stay together properly, especially the lettuce.</li>
                <li>I'd have smash burgers so they cook faster and they're just better.</li>
